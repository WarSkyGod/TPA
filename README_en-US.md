## About Configuration Migration

Version 3.2.0 added automatic migration for old configuration files, so there is no need to worry.  
However, for safety reasons, the old configuration files will be automatically backed up to the `plugins/TPA/backup/old version number` directory. If the migration fails, please manually attempt to migrate the configuration files.

## Acknowledgments

This plugin uses [FoliaLib](https://github.com/handyplus/FoliaLib) for **Folia** compatibility.
